Making Better Decisions: A Proposal for Human-Centered Computational Social Choice using Artificial Intelligence and Data

The research is organized around a Grand Challenge of building systems and developing the underlying algorithms necessary to facilitate better decisions in online, deliberative, and interactive environments in ways that align with human values and under human control. To tackle this grand challenge, the research will focus on (1) developing new data, models, and metrics of agent preferences for both outcomes and mechanisms, and (2) fundamental research to create novel algorithms and mechanisms for human-centered computational social choice, to create a use-inspired feedback loop with the broader impacts of the award. All code and data collected and developed as part of this project will be released in the unified PrefLib framework and the project will support students in service learning classes to work with local non-profit stakeholders.
