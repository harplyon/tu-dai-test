The Center for Community-Engaged Artificial Intelligence at Tulane University believes that AI will succeed only with the trust and support of the communities it affects, especially those from historically underserved groups. The motivating principle of the Center is that this trust must be earned by designing AI systems (1) that are demonstrably fair, transparent, and accountable, (2) that establish meaningful relationships to engage diverse communities in all stages of the AI process, from design through deployment, and (3) that augment, rather than replace, human interaction, i.e., are human centered. Achieving this vision requires a transformative approach to AI design. The Center will establish a truly multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers, social scientists, and community partners for examining and affording new evidence-based socio-technical frameworks to create and deploy AI systems that are inclusive, effective, fair, transparent, and accountable.
